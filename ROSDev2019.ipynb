    "- Quality check.. i.e. whether any change in your codebase has some effect on the production cycle time, or the battery misuse.. it's a pity that Luca talked about PCl filters and not functionality tests..\n",
    "- Generating data to feed machine learning knowledge\n",
    "- Aid the mechanical design.. I got a master student that used gazebo to test whether his idea of a car with som helix would work at all before even building it\n",
    "- Develop algorithms in remote, without having the need\n",
    "- And nowadays, as a support for selling.. if you see two ads of similar robots, where the motion of one are like faked, you konw, like bouncing at a different acceleration than gravity, and the other one is done through a simulation.. don't you think you would trust more to the one that is more phisycally plausible?"

We set the root link as the last link of the arm it is supposed to be attached to. This is just to work with the `robot_state_publisher`, so using the same name, we _fool_ `/tf` to have a unique tree. However, in gazebo, the gripper will fall to the floor.
