    "1. How to setup different robots in simulation using ros-controls\n",
    "2. How to use and create custom gazebo_ros plugins\n",
    "3. How to optimize the simulation from the model point of view\n",
    "4. Namespaces and launch files\n",

    "### Typical use cases of a simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Safety check.. i.e. test whether any change in your algorithms have some problems without breaking anything\n",
    "- Quality check.. i.e. whether any change in your codebase has some effect on the production cycle time, or the battery misuse.. it's a pity that Luca talked about PCl filters and not functionality tests..\n",
    "- Generating data to feed machine learning knowledge\n",
    "- Aid the mechanical design.. I got a master student that used gazebo to test whether his idea of a car with som helix would work at all before even building it\n",
    "- Develop algorithms in remote, without having the need\n",
    "- And nowadays, as a support for selling.. if you see two ads of similar robots, where the motion of one are like faked, you konw, like bouncing at a different acceleration than gravity, and the other one is done through a simulation.. don't you think you would trust more to the one that is more phisycally plausible?"

The combination of the robotic components are very common in universities and research center. The use of markers allows to have a simple but comprehensive sense-plan-actuate example with external sync (one player must wait for the other to finish the play to move), for educational or challenge purposes.\n",
